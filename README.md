# Fuzzy Logic Toolbox

## Overview
The **Fuzzy Logic Toolbox** is a Java-based tool for designing, implementing, and testing fuzzy logic systems. It provides a user-friendly GUI for defining fuzzy sets, inference rules, and performing defuzzification.

## Features
- Intuitive **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for managing fuzzy rules and variables.
- Supports **fuzzy inference systems** with multiple input and output variables.
- Provides **visualization tools** for understanding fuzzy set behavior.
- Includes **rule-based decision-making** for real-world applications.
- Outputs can be analyzed using **graphical representation**.
